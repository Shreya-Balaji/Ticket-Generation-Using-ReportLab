# Ticket-Generation-Using-ReportLab
This is a very basic ticket generation code using the ReportLab module in Python. 
This is specifically for an airline reservation system. 
It does not involve booking tickets, it just has a code to generate tickets based on data in the database after booking.

Make the following changes before using the code:
- Install modules listed in main.py file.
- I have used pymysql to integrate mysql with python. Update your credentials, if you're using pymysql as well.
- I have also used two images- barcode and round. Save it in your local PC and update the location.
- The ticket is generated on passing passenger_id. So pass the parameter appropriately.
- If you have doubts regarding the table and data used, check tabledata.txt
- Sample ticket generated pdf is also uploaded.
